# Instructions

We need to create classes for primary, middle, and high schools. Because these classes share properties and methods, each will inherit from a parent School class. Our parent and three child classes have the following properties, getters, setters, and methods:

## School

- Properties: name (string), level (one of three strings: 'primary', 'middle', or 'high'), and numberOfStudents (number)
- Getters: all properties have getters
- Setters: the numberOfStudents property has a setter
- Methods: .quickFacts() and .pickSubstituteTeacher() (this is a static method)

### Primary

- Includes everything in the School class, plus one additional property
- Properties: pickupPolicy (string)

### Middle

- Does not include any additional properties or methods.

### High

- Includes everything in the School class, plus one additional property
- Properties: sportsTeams (array of strings)
- If youâ€™re looking for a challenge, create the constructor() and getters for the four classes above. Then, use the setter and methods specifications in steps five, six, and seven to finish the project.

Extra: listed below some additional functionality to add.

- Add more properties to each class (averageTestScores, schoolOverview, etc.)
- Create a class called SchoolCatalog that holds a collection of schools. Create an instance of SchoolCatalog for primary, middle, and high schools.

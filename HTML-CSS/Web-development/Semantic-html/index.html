          New York City is made up of five boroughs which include Queens,
          Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The city is the
          home of approximately 8 million people. In 1876, France gifted the
          City of New York what is known as the Statue of Liberty, which is
          currently located on Ellis Island commonly visited by tourists.
          However, it took 10 years to assemble and therefore wasnâ€™t unveiled
          until 1886. Another tourist destination is Times Square. Times Square
          is commonly known for the big buildings, Broadway shows, and bright
          neon signs. This famous location was named after The New York Times
          after the Times moved to that location. Prior to that, it was named
          Longacre Square. New York City is also known for its bridges that
          connect the boroughs and allow ease of transportation.

            styles and scripts may be defined in the page or link to another
            file that has the information.

                  commonly used to link to stylesheets, but is also used to
                  establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and icons for
                  the home screen and apps on mobile devices) among other

          <h2>Semantic HTML</h2>
          <p>
            Semantic HTML introduces meaning to the code we write. Before
            Semantic HTML the elements didn’t have any meaning as to what it
            does or what content goes in it. An element such as &lt;div&gt; was
            used as a general-purpose element to create things from headers to
            footers to articles. With Semantic HTML we were introduced to
            elements that tell developers and browsers exactly what it does and
            what content should go in it.
          </p>
          <h2>Element Placement</h2>
          <p>
            Semantic HTML introduces elements that can tell developers exactly
            what the element does or where it’s placed based on the name of that
            element.
          </p>

            <thead>
              <tr>

                <td>
                  element represents introductory content, typically a group of
                  introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading
                  elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and
                  other elements.

                  represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only
                  one &lt;body&gt; element in a document.

                  and the footer areas.

                  includes the page's footer content at the bottom of the
                  &lt;body&gt; typically information about the author of the
                  section, copyright data or links related documents.

                  <strong>&lt;section&gt;</strong> defines elements in a
                  document, such as chapters, headings, or any other area of the
                  document with the same theme.

              <tr>
                <td>&lt;article&gt;</td>
                <td>
                  <strong>&lt;article&gt;</strong> holds content that makes
                  sense on its own such as articles, blogs, and comments.
                  Generally developers will use &lt;section&gt; to define a
                  theme for the webpage and use &lt;article&gt; to write
                  independent content for that theme. This does not mean that
                  &lt;article&gt; has to be used with &lt;section&gt;.

              <tr>
                <td>&lt;aside&gt;</td>
                <td>
                  <strong>&lt;aside&gt;</strong> is used to mark additional
                  information that can enhance another element but isn’t
                  required in order to understand the main content. Usually this
                  information would be in a sidebar or a location where it
                  doesn’t obstruct the main piece of content. An example of this
                  would be an article that discusses how to take care of a dog
                  and next to the article an ad would appear advertising a dog
                  grooming product.
